# HUST ONLINE JUDGE SYSTEM

HUSTOJ is a Open Source Online Judge System for ACM/ICPC, use for [HUST ACM Team](http://acm.hust.edu.cn).

User can register and read the problem description, submit their code to server, the server will compile and run the code, judge the output is right.

This is a new version based on [hustoj](http://code.google.com/p/hustoj/), which created by [Sempr](https://github.com/sempr), maintained by zhblue. Sempr and me think [hustoj](http://code.google.com/p/hustoj/) is too stupid, so I decide refactor the application.

## Features

* Use PHP 5, [Kohana](http://kohanaframework.org/)
* Use [twitter bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap)
* Use [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org)
* Full function for administrator
* Atom feed output
