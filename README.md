# HUST ONLINE JUDGE SYSTEM

HUSTOJ is a Open Source Online Judge System for ACM/ICPC, origin for [HUST ACM Team](http://acm.hust.edu.cn).

User can register and read the problem description, submit their code to servrer, then the server will compile and run the code, judge the output is right.

This is a new version based on [hustoj](http://code.google.com/p/hustoj/), which created by [Sempr](https://github.com/sempr), my beast friends. We think the old system is too stupid, So I decide refactor the judge system.
